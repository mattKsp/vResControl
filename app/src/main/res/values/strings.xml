    <string name="dialog_about_title">About</string>
    <string name="dialog_about_text">This app is for basic control of Resolume \n \nWritten by matt standish \nCopyright (&#169;) 2016 \nM T S Standish | ksp \n \nThis software is provided on an AS-IS-BASIS \n  \n \nIMPORTANT \nThis app cannot currently cope with bundles \nMake sure Bundles are turned OFF in Resolume OSC Preferences \n \n \n. A few things left to fix. Not optimised for tablets yet. \n \n. The layout is intentionally minimal. There is not much screen space on a mobile device, and there are not many different ways to re-arrange things in grids. \n \n. Communication is done via OSC/UDP over WIFI/LAN. Resolume accepts input from many devices at once, this enables several people to VJ together pretty easily (..but unfortunately Resolume can only talk back to 1 device) \n</string>
